          made of concrete blocks.”<br> - Willy Brandt, at the first meeting of the all-German parliament at the
          Reichstag in December 1990. </p>

          <p>The fall of the Berlin Wall was a pivotal event in world history
            which marked the falling of the Iron Curtain and the start of the fall of communism in Eastern and Central
            Europe. The fall of the inner German border took place shortly afterwards. An end to the Cold War was
            declared at the Malta Summit three weeks later, and the reunification of Germany took place in October the
            following year.</p>

          <p>Removal of the Wall began on the evening of 9 November 1989 and continued over the following days and
            weeks, with people nicknamed Mauerspechte (wallpeckers) using various tools to chip off souvenirs,
            demolishing lengthy parts in the process, and creating several unofficial border crossings.</p>

          <p>On 13 June 1990, the East German Border Troops officially began dismantling the Wall. Virtually every road
            that was severed by the Berlin Wall, every road that once linked from West Berlin to East Berlin, was
            reconstructed and reopened by 1 August 1990. </p>

        <div class="col-md-3 column">
          <h3>The result of an accident</h3>
          <p>The wall was breached as a result of an accident. The East German government were producing a new set of
            regulations to make it easier for East Germans to travel, using visas. The intention was to announce the
            changes on the evening of 9 November, and introduce the new system the next morning. However, when Günter
            Schabowski, a member of the East German Politburo who served as its spokesman, was asked at a live press
            conference when the new rules
            would come into effect, he blundered and said ‘immediately’. Shortly after this surprise development,
            hundreds of East Berliners started to turn up at the sector crossing points – the crowds swelled into
            thousands. The GDR border guards were normally under orders to stop anyone crossing. They had no fresh
            instructions, and decided spontaneously to open the barriers, enabling thousands to pour through.</p>

          <p>French President, François Mitterrand, and British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, both opposed the fall
            of
            the Berlin Wall and the eventual reunification of Germany, fearing potential German designs on its
            neighbours using its increased strength. <br> <br> In September 1989, Margaret Thatcher privately confided
            to Soviet
            General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev that she wanted the Soviet leader to do what he could to stop
            it.
            <br><br>
            "We do not want a united Germany. This would lead to a change to postwar borders and we cannot allow that
            because such a development would undermine the stability of the whole international situation and could
            endanger our security," Thatcher told Gorbachev.</p>

            Gate. Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich played music by Johann Sebastian Bach, while German rock band
            Scorpions performed their 1990 song Wind of Change. Wreaths were placed for victims shot down when attempts
            to escape to west, and politicians delivered speeches.</p>

          <p class="lead"> Other celebrations and anniversaries:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>On 25 December 1989, Leonard Bernstein gave a concert in Berlin celebrating the end of the Wall,
              including Beethoven's 9th symphony (Ode to Joy) with the word "Joy" (Freude) changed to "Freedom"
              (Freiheit) in the lyrics sung</li>
            <li>On New Year's Eve 1989, David Hasselhoff performed his song "Looking for Freedom" while standing atop
              the partly demolished wall.</li>
            <li>Roger Waters performed the Pink Floyd album The Wall just north of Potsdamer Platz on 21 July 1990, with
